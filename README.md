# Gamma Hadron Classification

## Dataset

- The dataset is called magic04.csv dataset gotten from UCI repository.

- The data are MC generated (see below) to simulate registration of high energy gamma particles in a ground-based atmospheric Cherenkov gamma telescope using the imaging technique. Cherenkov gamma telescope observes high energy gamma rays, taking advantage of the radiation emitted by charged particles produced inside the electromagnetic showers initiated by the gammas, and developing in the atmosphere.

### Features

There are 10 features used to identify the target.

1. fLength: continuous # major axis of ellipse [mm]
2. fWidth: continuous # minor axis of ellipse [mm]
3. fSize: continuous # 10-log of sum of content of all pixels [in #phot]
4. fConc: continuous # ratio of sum of two highest pixels over fSize [ratio]
5. fConc1: continuous # ratio of highest pixel over fSize [ratio]
6. fAsym: continuous # distance from highest pixel to center, projected onto major axis [mm]
7. fM3Long: continuous # 3rd root of third moment along major axis [mm]
8. fM3Trans: continuous # 3rd root of third moment along minor axis [mm]
9. fAlpha: continuous # angle of major axis with vector to origin [deg]
10. fDist: continuous # distance from origin to center of ellipse [mm]

### Target

- Target there are two classes Gamma and Hadron.

- class: g,h # gamma (signal), hadron (background)

## How to run the code

- Clone the repo.

- Run the requirements.txt file

- Run the Jupyter Notebook.
